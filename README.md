# gem5 Documentation Q&A Agent

A simple tool to help developers and researchers find answers from the extensive gem5 documentation using natural language.

## The Problem

The gem5 simulator is a powerful and complex tool with comprehensive documentation. However, navigating through hundreds of pages to find a specific piece of information can be time-consuming and difficult, especially for newcomers.

## The Solution

This project aims to solve that problem by providing an intelligent Q&A agent. It works by:

1.  **Scraping:** Systematically crawling and parsing the official gem5 documentation website.
2.  **Chunking & Storing:** Breaking the content down into meaningful, semantically-aware chunks and storing them as vector embeddings in a database.
3.  **Retrieval & Generation:** When a user asks a question, the agent retrieves the most relevant chunks of documentation from the database and uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to synthesize a clear, concise answer based on that context.

This approach is known as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

## Current Status

This project is currently under development. The core pipeline for scraping and basic Q&A is being built.

## Future Work

- [ ] Implement an intent-routing model to handle different types of queries more effectively.
- [ ] Build a simple, user-friendly interface using Streamlit.
- [ ] Experiment with different chunking strategies and embedding models to improve answer quality.

## Getting Started
